I'm a product designer based in Austin, Texas, graduated from Southwestern University with a Sociology degree - focus on qualitative research and data, and have experience with managing, sales and customer service, and in IT and administrative roles. Around Nov. 2019, I'll work in Product Design, UX role that utilizes creativity and collaboration. Combining insights in data gathering and inclination to natural and minimalist design for UX to create an inclusive and universal design requires keeping the end user in mind.

To me, product design means finding out what the users do, think, and need during an activity, and understanding where do they struggle and enjoy during the journey. This allows me to create a helpful product to the user. Creating a great product would require surface level and in-depth interpretations of their feedback. Catering to the users would lead to increased engagement and loyalty with the product
